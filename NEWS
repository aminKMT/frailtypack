Changes in Version 2.4.1         Apr 2013

  o Bug fixed about estimation of frailties in shared models using recurrentAG=TRUE
  
  o Printing bug about standard deviation of the random effet variance in a model without covariate.

  o Possibility to initialize regression coefficients in shared and joint frailty models 

  
Changes in Version 2.4           Apr 2013
  
  o Fit now a model with time-varying effects for covariates (only for Cox, shared gamma and a joint gamma frailty model).


Changes in Version 2.3           Feb 2013

  o Fit now a Shared and a Joint Frailty model with a log-normal distribution for the random effects.

  o "Breast cosmesis" dataset added for interval-censoring illustration ("Diabetes" dataset removed).

  o Weibull hazard parameters bug fixed : shape and scale were reversed.

  o Linear predictors : output reorganized.

  o Plot options improved (now color is allowed).

  o Use of 'SurvIC' function modified. Now for the left-truncated and interval-censored data we use : SurvIC(left-trunc-time,lower-time,upper-time,event).

  o No need of the intcens argument to fit a model for interval-censored data anymore, 'SurvIC' function is enough.


Changes in Version 2.2-27        Nov 2012

  o Fit now a Joint Frailty model for clustered data.


Changes in Version 2.2-26        Oct 2012

  o Minor bug fixed about loglikelihood in Nested Frailty model.

  o The package accepts samples unsorted on clusters.


Changes in Version 2.2-25        Sep 2012

  o "Diabetes" dataset added for interval-censoring illustration.


Changes in Version 2.2-24        Jul 2012

  o Fit a Shared Gamma Frailty or a Cox proportional hazard model for interval-censored data.

  o No longer need to use cluster function for fitting a Cox proportional hazard model.

  o Minor bug fixed in Nested Frailty model.

  o Printing bug fixed in multivariate Wald test.


Changes in Version 2.2-22        mar 2012

  o Fit a Shared Gamma Frailty model using a parametric estimation.

  o Fit Joint Frailty model for recurrent and terminal events using a parametric estimation.

  o Fit a Nested Frailty model using a parametric estimation.

  o Fit an Additive Frailty model using a parametric estimation.

  o Concordance measures in shared frailty and Cox models (Cmeasures).


Changes in Version 2.2-10

  o NEW VERSION OF FRAILTYPACK including Additive, Nested and Joint Frailty models
  o Paper submitted to Journal of Stat Software
